"""agentctl.osctl — OS-level input, clipboard and screen capture.

CDP can only reach what lives *inside* a page.  Real GUIs leak outside the DOM:
the omnibox, Chrome's own "Leave site?" / basic-auth / file-chooser dialogs,
other windows entirely (F005).  ``osctl`` is the escape hatch — it drives the
machine through trusted synthetic input, the clipboard, and a screen grab — so
the agent keeps operating where the browser channel goes blind.

The standout primitive is **atomic paste into the omnibox**: per-character typing
into Chrome's address bar loses keystrokes to history autocomplete (F003).  The
robust path is clipboard + Ctrl+V — one trusted event, nothing to race.

The OS floor is the one platform-specific layer, so it is delegated to a backend
chosen at import (F141): Win32 ``SendInput``/GDI on Windows, X11 + XTEST on Linux
(``_osbackend_win`` / ``_osbackend_x11``). Everything below this header — the
gesture vocabulary and the whole perception side — is platform-agnostic and built
only on the backend's leaf primitives. No third-party deps on either ground: the
PNG encoder is hand-rolled with ``zlib`` so a screenshot is always available.

    full-screen ``find_color``+click missed every time (~265 px off), because the

    1. **Acquire with the periphery, refine with the fovea.** A coarse ``step``

       peripheral vision), then :func:`foveate` re-reads that small window at full
       acuity — total acquire is ms, not hundreds of ms, so the target is still in
       the fovea when we look again.
    2. **Predict, don't chase.** Smooth pursuit does not aim where the target *is*
       (that image is already old by one neural delay); it estimates the target's
       velocity and aims where it *will be*. So sample the fovea twice (``gap`` s
       apart) for a velocity, then click the position extrapolated ``lead`` seconds
       ahead — ``lead`` being the perceive→click-lands latency. With ``lead=0`` this
       degrades to a pure (non-predictive) foveated reach.

    Every other primitive here reads a *single* ``capture_rgb`` snapshot, but a
    live UI animates: by the time a synthesised click lands, an element that was
    sliding/teleporting has moved on, so the click hits where the target *used to
    be*. The result is the usual ``find_color`` dict plus ``settled`` (bool),
    ``samples`` (int) and ``saccades`` (full-screen re-acquisitions).

    Why pursuit, not a fixed-rate full-screen poll. A whole-screen ``find_color``
    scan is *slow* (millions of pixels in Python), so a fixed poll samples the
    page only a few times a second — slower than a 180 ms animation step. Then two
    successive samples can land an even number of steps apart and read the *same*
    spot, so the motion is **undersampled** (Nyquist) and it can "settle" mid-flight.
    The eye does not solve this by staring at the whole wall faster; it *foveates* —
    a tiny high-acuity window it can re-read tens of times a second — and **pursues**
    the target, **saccading** only when the target leaves that window. So here:
    acquire once with a full grab, then track inside a ``2·radius`` fovea via
    :func:`foveate` at a fast poll. While the fovea keeps finding the target within
    ``move_tol`` it is at rest; hold that for a wall-clock ``settle_frames·interval``
    seconds and it is settled. The instant the target leaves the fovea — a teleport,
    or a slide past the window — that *absence* is the motion signal (大音希聲: the
    silence is the note): re-anchor with one full-screen saccade and keep pursuing.
    Because the dense sampling is foveal (cheap) the sampler always out-paces the
    motion, and because leaving the fovea resets the hold, it cannot false-settle
    mid-motion — on either platform, with no cadence tuning to a particular display.

    The region carries the answer. A label is a large flat field of *background*
    pixels with a sparse scatter of *ink* on top: quantise the region to ``q``-step

    the most frequent bucket that lies *far* from it (L1 distance ``> min_dist``).

    Honest about absence: a *uniform* region (a blank panel, a solid fill) has no
    bucket far from its background, so ``fg`` is ``None`` — there is no ink to read,
    and it says so rather than promoting a fringe or noise pixel to "the colour".

    alone — no glyph atlas (F181).

    Every reader from F103 on (:func:`read_text`, :func:`locate_word`) needs an
    ``atlas`` of the target font's glyphs, and the only way the floor could build
    one was rendering reference glyphs *itself* on a browser scratch canvas — so
    it stayed literate only on the web and blind to every *native* canvas app
    (Blender, a CAD viewport, a video timeline) whose font it cannot reproduce.
    Harvesting an atlas from the app's *own* rendering founders one rung lower, on
    *glyph* segmentation: a ~9px proportional anti-aliased label fuses or splits
    its letters unreliably (``"File"`` cuts into four, ``"Render"`` shatters into
    twelve), so per-character reading is lost — that is the named boundary of the
    atlas path on small native type.

    But you do not need to *read* a menu bar / dropdown / toolbar / tab strip to
    *act* on it: it is an *ordered sequence of known labels* parted by *wide* blank
    space, and item-level gaps are far larger and far more reliable than the
    inter-letter gaps that defeat glyph segmentation. With ``axis="x"`` this
    :func:`segment_run`-s ``bbox`` by the foreground colour ``fg`` into
    blank-*column*-separated runs (a horizontal bar/tab strip); with ``axis="y"``
    it parts the region into blank-*row*-separated bands (a vertical dropdown — the
    even more reliable case, since menu rows are spaced wider than letters are
    tall). Either way, *only when* the run count equals ``len(labels)`` it returns
    ``{label: rect}`` pairing each label to its run in reading order — a click
    target for every label, located by meaning, in the screen frame
    :func:`capture_rgb` and :func:`click` share, independent of pixel coordinates,
    window position or theme. Hand any rect's centre to :func:`click` to press the
    label you named.

    Honest boundary: it commits only when it can form *exactly* ``len(labels)``
    bands; if it cannot, it returns ``{}`` rather than risk pairing a label to the
    wrong box. It locates *known* labels in *known* order; it does not read unknown
    text (that is the atlas path, bounded above). Choose ``fg`` as the label ink
    colour; ``gap`` only seeds the fast path below.

    Two segmenters, fast then count-driven (F181). The fast path is a single fixed
    ``gap`` blank-run cut (:func:`segment_run` on ``x``, :func:`_segment_rows` on
    ``y``) — it nails *uniform* strips (a menu bar, a plain dropdown) in one pass.
    But a real menu is rarely uniform: the File menu interleaves shortcut text,
    submenu arrows and several separator rules, so *no* single ``gap`` yields the
    right band count (too small splits a separator in two, too large fuses two
    items). The robust path borrows the exact discipline of :func:`split_run`,
    which parts *touching glyphs* by cutting at the ``n-1`` deepest valleys once it
    is told the glyph count ``n``: here the honest extra knowledge is the *label*
    count, so when the fast path's band count ≠ ``len(labels)`` we cut the ink
    profile at its ``len(labels)-1`` **widest blank valleys** — exactly enough cuts
    to make exactly that many bands, robust to uneven item spacing because it ranks
    gaps relatively instead of thresholding them absolutely. It still degrades
    honestly: if there are fewer than ``len(labels)-1`` interior gaps, or any band
    comes out empty, it yields ``{}`` rather than a mispairing."""

    :func:`scroll` (F119) can reach past the fold, but only by a *guessed* amount:
    the caller must know how many notches the target lies below, and a fixed roll
    over- or under-shoots — too few and the word never enters the frame, too many
    and it flies past the top and out again (the F119 probe lost ``GO`` at the
    first overshoot). And :func:`locate_phrase` still only reads the one screenful
    it is handed. To *find* text on a surface taller than the window you must
    search and scroll together, and know when to stop.

    This marries the two. It looks for ``target`` in the current frame
    (:func:`locate_phrase` over ``bbox``); finding it, returns its bbox at once.
    Else it rolls the wheel down ``step`` notches over ``(x, y)`` (the region's

    where to press it, the window walking itself to the text instead of the caller
    counting notches.

    It bounds the search by ``max_steps`` rather than by pixels-stopped-changing,
    and that is deliberate honesty: a long blank stretch scrolls past while the
    captured screen does not change a single byte (the scrollbar thumb does not
    register in a GDI grab), so "the frame held still" cannot tell *bottomed out*
    from *still travelling through emptiness* — a pixel-only reader simply has no
    truthful bottom signal, and pretending one (stopping on a still frame) would
    abandon a target that lies just past the blank. So it promises only to look
    across ``max_steps`` successive screenfuls; set ``max_steps`` to cover the
    surface (``page_height / screenful`` rolls of ``step``).

    Honest in its parts' frames at every step (banded rows, bimodal seams,
    ``atlas`` glyphs, text colours) and honest about its reach: it reads only what
    each roll reveals and declares failure only after exhausting ``max_steps``.
