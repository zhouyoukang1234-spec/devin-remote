"""agentctl.osctl — OS-level input, clipboard and screen capture.

CDP can only reach what lives *inside* a page.  Real GUIs leak outside the DOM:
the omnibox, Chrome's own "Leave site?" / basic-auth / file-chooser dialogs,
other windows entirely (F005).  ``osctl`` is the escape hatch — it drives the
machine through trusted synthetic input, the clipboard, and a screen grab — so
the agent keeps operating where the browser channel goes blind.

The standout primitive is **atomic paste into the omnibox**: per-character typing
into Chrome's address bar loses keystrokes to history autocomplete (F003).  The
robust path is clipboard + Ctrl+V — one trusted event, nothing to race.

The OS floor is the one platform-specific layer, so it is delegated to a backend
chosen at import (F141): Win32 ``SendInput``/GDI on Windows, X11 + XTEST on Linux
(``_osbackend_win`` / ``_osbackend_x11``). Everything below this header — the
gesture vocabulary and the whole perception side — is platform-agnostic and built
only on the backend's leaf primitives. No third-party deps on either ground: the
PNG encoder is hand-rolled with ``zlib`` so a screenshot is always available.

    * it can **refuse** the write (wxWidgets number fields return ``SetValue`` failure),
    * or it can **fake** it — a Qt Scintilla code editor returns ``SetValue`` *success*
      yet writes nothing, so a verb that believed the return code would report a write
      that never happened.

    A read-back that equals ``value`` is the only proof the write landed. Absent that,
    this reaches for the **keyboard floor**, which cannot lie: give the field focus and
    type. Focus too is taken the human way — a **real click on the field's centre** —
    since UIA ``SetFocus`` likewise *reports* success on custom widgets without moving the
    real caret; a click on the rect puts the caret where the pixels are. So "set this
    field" holds whether the toolkit models a truthful ValuePattern, a lying one, or only
    lets a person type. Composed of existing leaves (``uia_find`` + the click/key floor).
    Returns True once the value is written or typed; falls back to the pattern's own claim
    only when the field can be neither clicked nor focused (e.g. off-screen).

    The keyboard floor can lie too: typing into a **read-only** field (a caption, a
    disabled box, a log view) changes nothing, yet a click+type would blindly report
    success — exactly the bug a real Notepad++ Replace dialog exposed, where the label,
    combo and edit all shared one name. So the typed path is held to the *same* proof as
    the pattern path: a read-back. The write is trusted only when the value actually
    became ``value`` or at least *changed* from before; it stays optimistic only when the

    is impossible without first knowing the current point. (3) Polite flows that
    move the cursor aside and then restore it had nothing to restore *to*. This

    every click — addresses an *absolute* screen pixel. That is exactly right for a

    whole class of surfaces *grabs* the pointer and reads only its **motion**: an FPS
    in mouse-look, a 3D editor's orbit drag, any Pointer-Lock canvas (WebGL games,

    F261 gave :func:`move_rel`: a relative actuator that turns an FPS camera (or
    pans a Pointer-Lock canvas, orbits a 3D view) by emitting motion deltas. But a
    relative actuator hides the one number absolute :func:`move` always knew — *how
    far one unit travels on screen*. ``move(x, y)`` lands on pixel ``(x, y)``; one
    ``move_rel`` count turns the camera by an angle, and how many **pixels** the
    target then slides depends on the field of view and the surface's own
    sensitivity — unknown to the floor, and (measured live in AssaultCube) only
    locally linear: ~1.3 px/count near centre, but a count large enough to "snap"
    overshoots and the feature leaves the window entirely. So a relative actuator
    *cannot* aim in one shot the way :func:`move` clicks in one shot: there is no
    delta to compute without first knowing the scale, and the scale must be
    *measured*, not assumed. Every realtime target task hit this same wall — react
    (F260) says *when*, move_rel (F261) says *turn*, but nothing *closed the loop*
    between seeing where a thing is and steering it where it should be.

    This is that loop, and nothing smaller is. ``locate()`` returns the feature's
    current ``(x, y)`` (e.g. a :func:`find_color` centroid or a :func:`match_template`
    match) or ``None`` if lost; ``target`` is where it should end up (e.g. the
    crosshair / viewport centre); ``actuate(dx, dy)`` emits a relative motion of
    ``dx, dy`` actuator units (defaults to :func:`move_rel`). With ``gain`` unknown
    (the common case) it first **calibrates**: one small ``probe`` nudge per axis,
    measuring the resulting pixel displacement to learn signed units-per-pixel —
    the sign too, so it never has to be told that turning the view right slides the
    world left. Then it steers proportionally — ``step = error * gain * damping``,
    clamped to ``max_step`` so a rough estimate cannot fling the feature out of
    sight — re-locating after each move (``settle`` lets the frame render) until the
    feature is within ``tol`` pixels of ``target`` or ``max_iter`` steps run out.
    ``damping`` < 1 keeps it from overshooting on an approximate gain (the loop
    converges geometrically rather than ringing).

    Returns ``{hit, iters, err, gain, pos, start, reason}``: ``hit`` True when the
    feature settled within ``tol``; ``err`` the final pixel distance; ``gain`` the
    ``(kx, ky)`` units-per-pixel used (the calibration is the reusable part — pass
    it back as ``gain`` to skip re-probing once learned); ``reason`` is ``"hit"``,
    ``"max_iter"``, or ``"lost"``. Call it once to snap onto a still target; call it
    repeatedly to *track* a moving one (each call a fresh closed-loop correction).

    of pixels and dominates a perceive→act loop (hundreds of ms); the retina's
    *periphery* is likewise low-resolution — it does not read every receptor.
    A coarse ``step`` finds *where* a solid region is in a fraction of the time
    (the centroid of a uniform blob is unbiased under regular subsampling); then
    re-locate at full acuity in a small window (see :func:`foveate`) to refine.
    ``count`` is the number of *matched samples* (≈ area/step²), so a threshold

    chrome (a white Mahjongg tile face is also every white pixel of the side
    panel and neighbouring apps) and paid a full-screen scan for a board that

    ``find_color`` collapses every matching pixel into one centroid — fine for a

    empty gap *between* them and clicks nothing. This labels matching pixels into
    connected components (4-connectivity, union-find over only the matched
    pixels, so cost scales with the colour's area, not the screen) and returns
    one ``{x, y, count, bbox}`` per region in *screen* coordinates, sorted by
    pixel count (largest first). Pick by size or position; each centroid is a
    real, clickable target. Regions smaller than ``min_count`` are dropped.

    ``search`` (F240): an optional ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` window (screen
    coordinates, clamped to the capture) to scan, mirroring :func:`find_color`
    and :func:`match_template`. Bounding the colour segmentation to the known
    region of interest stops same-coloured regions in other windows/chrome from
    appearing as spurious blobs and avoids a whole-screen scan when the target
    occupies only a fraction of it. Returned coordinates stay absolute.

    ``step`` (F271): *acuity*, exactly as :func:`find_color` already has it but the

    ``step=n`` only every n-th pixel on every n-th row is sampled, so the scan does
    ``~1/n²`` the work and connectivity is judged on the *sample lattice* (a matched
    sample unions with the matched sample ``n`` to its left / ``n`` above). A solid
    blob's centroid is unbiased under regular subsampling, so a coarse pass finds
    *where* separate targets are for a fraction of the cost — the same trade
    ``find_color`` offers a lone target, now for *several*. ``count`` is matched
    *samples* (≈ area/n²), so a ``min_count`` threshold must account for ``step``,
    and ``bbox`` is rounded to the sample grid; re-locate at ``step=1`` in a small
    window (see :func:`foveate`) when a blob needs pixel-exact extents. A tight
    perceive→act loop over *distinct* same-coloured targets had to pay a full-
    resolution segmentation every frame (measured ~130 ms on a 1.5 MP field, ~6×
    the move+click it gated); ``step`` is how that loop buys back its rate."""

    full-screen ``find_color``+click missed every time (~265 px off), because the
    232 ms whole-screen scan alone is ages of motion. Two corrections, both how
    the visuomotor system actually does it:

    1. **Acquire with the periphery, refine with the fovea.** A coarse ``step``
       scan finds *where* the target roughly is in a few ms (low-acuity, like
       peripheral vision), then :func:`foveate` re-reads that small window at full
       acuity — total acquire is ms, not hundreds of ms, so the target is still in
       the fovea when we look again.
    2. **Predict, don't chase.** Smooth pursuit does not aim where the target *is*
       (that image is already old by one neural delay); it estimates the target's
       velocity and aims where it *will be*. So sample the fovea twice (``gap`` s
       apart) for a velocity, then click the position extrapolated ``lead`` seconds
       ahead — ``lead`` being the perceive→click-lands latency. With ``lead=0`` this
       degrades to a pure (non-predictive) foveated reach.

    ``wait_for_phrase`` waits for *text* to appear, but much of a GUI moves
    without ever spelling anything: a panel slides in, a spinner turns, a list
    reflows, a fade settles. Act mid-transition and the target is still in
    flight — the click lands where the thing *was*, not where it comes to rest.
    Nothing in the pixel channel waited for *motion to end*. This re-captures the
    ``bbox`` region every ``interval`` and compares it to the last capture; once
    ``settle`` consecutive captures match, the region is judged at rest. Returns
    ``{stable, changes, captures, elapsed}`` — ``stable`` is whether it settled
    before ``timeout``, ``changes`` how many times the region differed (proof it
    really was moving), so the caller can both wait and confirm something
    happened. The visual twin of ``wait_for_phrase``: one waits for a word, the
    other for stillness.

    Sameness is measured through :func:`region_diff` with ``tol``/``min_count``
    (F244): two captures *match* when fewer than ``min_count`` pixels differ by

    capture — the grid generalisation of :func:`sample_color` (F247).

    Tetris, mines, sudoku, a chess board, a mahjongg layer: a recurring GUI is a
    fixed lattice of equal cells, and the question is *what is in every cell*.
    The floor only had :func:`sample_color`, which reads one region — so each of
    those games hand-rolls the same double loop, calling ``sample_color`` (or
    cropping) once per cell. That is two avoidable costs paid on every frame:
    the geometry is recomputed by every caller, and each call crops a fresh
    buffer and then averages the *whole* cell — hundreds of cells x hundreds of
    pixels of pure-Python summation, ~18 ms for a 10x20 board — which a real-time
    game (a falling piece) cannot spend per tick.

    This divides ``bbox`` into ``cols``x``rows`` equal cells and returns a
    ``rows``x``cols`` list of ``{r, g, b, count}`` cells. Two losses are cut
    (損之又損): it indexes straight into the one capture instead of allocating a
    crop per cell, and it reads only each cell's central window — ``inset`` is
    the fraction trimmed off every side (default ``0.25`` keeps the central half
    in each axis, ~a quarter of the pixels), which both skips the grid lines /
    borders between cells (so a separator never pollutes a cell's colour) and
    reads far fewer pixels. ``inset`` only changes which pixels are read, not the
    coordinate or packing convention, so each cell matches a centred
    ``sample_color``. Pass an existing ``rgb``/``size`` to reuse a capture (pair
    with :func:`capture_patch` to read just the board).

    ``stat`` chooses how a cell's pixels reduce to one colour:

    - ``"mean"`` (default) averages them — for a solid-filled cell the centre
      mean equals the whole-cell mean, and it matches a centred ``sample_color``.
    - ``"mode"`` returns the *fill* — the mean of the largest cluster of similar
      pixels — and is **immune to a foreground mark** painted on that fill. The
      mean of a cell conflates background and mark in proportion to how much of
      the cell the mark covers, so two cells with the *same* fill but differently
      sized marks read as *different* colours (and the discriminating signal, the
      fill, is lost): a minesweeper theme that tints the cell by its count (1 =
      green, 2 = tan) carries a dark digit whose ink grows with the count, so the
      mean of a "2" is dragged further from its tan fill than a "1" from its
      green — the very signal you want to read is corrupted by the very glyph
      sitting on it. ``"mode"`` buckets the cell's pixels into a coarse colour
      histogram (each channel quantised to ``quant``-wide bins, default 24),
      takes the most-populated bin (the fill always outvotes the glyph, which is
      a minority of the central window), and returns the *exact* mean of the
      pixels in that bin — a precise, mark-immune fill colour. ``count`` is the
      number of pixels that fell in the modal bin (its dominance); a near-solid
      cell approaches the full window. Reading the fill under a mark generalises
      past mines — a button's colour under its label, a card's colour under its
      number, a token's team colour under its symbol, or simply telling a covered
      cell from an empty one from a numbered one by fill alone, at any size where
      the glyph itself is too small to read."""

    """Read a ``cols``x``rows`` lattice of glyphs into a 2D array of strings, in
    one capture — the OCR grid that :func:`sample_grid` is for colour (F251).

    Reading a board of glyphs (a sudoku of digits, a chess rank of pieces, a
    mahjongg face) is a recurring need, but the floor only offered the single-
    region :func:`ocr_text` — so every caller (the sudoku and mines players both
    do) hand-rolls the *same* triple: the geometry double-loop, a per-cell
    ink/colour gate, and the ``whitelist``/``psm``/``scale`` tuning. Two costs
    repeat on every board: each caller re-derives that orchestration, and the
    naive version OCRs *every* cell — which is both slow (a sparse 9x9 sudoku is
    ~21 filled of 81, so ~60 wasted reads) and, worse, *wrong*: tesseract handed
    an empty bordered cell hallucinates a stray glyph (an empty grey sudoku cell
    reads as ``"a"``), so a reader with no gate mis-fills the board.

    This divides ``bbox`` into ``cols``x``rows`` equal cells with the *exact*
    geometry of :func:`sample_grid`/:func:`grid_changes` (same ``inset``, same
    bounds clamping, so the ``[r][c]`` indices line up one-to-one) and, for each
    cell, gates on ink before reading: it measures the cell's central window and
    counts pixels whose luminance deviates from the window mean by more than
    ``ink_tol``. A cell with fewer than ``ink_min`` such pixels is treated as
    blank — returned as ``""`` and **never sent to OCR** — which both removes the
    empty-cell hallucination and skips the dominant cost on a sparse board (the
    F250 lesson — don't read what holds nothing — applied to OCR). Only inked
    cells are passed to :func:`ocr_text` with the given ``whitelist``/``psm``/
    ``scale``/``invert``; its result is stripped and stored. Returns a
    ``rows``x``cols`` list of strings (``""`` = blank). Pass ``rgb``/``size`` to
    reuse a capture (pair with :func:`capture_patch` to read just the board).

    Two ways to place the cells. By default ``bbox`` is divided into equal cells
    (the :func:`sample_grid` convention). But a real board's pitch is rarely
    perfectly uniform — a sudoku's heavy 3x3 rules make some cells a pixel wider
    — and where colour sampling shrugs that off, an OCR crop does not: a couple
    of pixels of accumulated drift shifts a mid-board crop onto the cell edge,
    clips the glyph, and tesseract then reads *nothing*. So this also takes the
    exact column/row edges ``xs`` (``cols+1`` x-coords) and ``ys`` (``rows+1``
    y-coords) — precisely what :func:`detect_grid` returns — and when given uses
    each cell's true ``[xs[c], xs[c+1]]`` x ``[ys[r], ys[r+1]]`` box instead of
    the uniform split, so every crop is centred on its glyph. The intended
    pipeline is ``g = detect_grid(...); ocr_grid(g['bbox'], g['cols'], g['rows'],
    xs=g['xs'], ys=g['ys'], ...)``.

    The ink gate is polarity-agnostic (it measures deviation from the cell's own
    mean, so it fires for dark-on-light *and* light-on-dark without ``invert``);
    ``invert`` still controls what :func:`ocr_text` sees for the read itself.

    ``invert`` is normally a bool, applied to every cell alike. But one board can
    mix polarities *within itself* — a tetravex tile carries white digits on its
    dark triangles and black digits on its light ones, a themed grid flips ink per
    chip — and then no single bool reads them all: tesseract wants dark-on-light,
    so the wrong-polarity cells come back empty (F255). Pass ``invert="auto"`` to
    decide per cell: the gate already measured the cell's mean and its ink pixels

    template library — the grid that :func:`match_template` is for one patch, and
    the appearance counterpart of :func:`ocr_grid` (which reads text) and
    :func:`sample_grid` (which reads colour) (F252).

    Some boards are neither colour nor text. A chess square is a vector glyph, a
    mahjongg face a tile picture, a minesweeper cell an icon: :func:`sample_grid`
    sees only that a piece is *present* and its shade (a black rook and a black
    queen sample to the *same* luma, so colour cannot tell type), and
    :func:`ocr_grid` reads nothing from a non-text glyph. The floor had only the
    single-patch :func:`match_template`, which *locates* one sprite — so reading a
    whole board means hand-rolling the same per-cell loop: crop the cell, score it
    against every candidate sprite, take the best, and gate out the empties.

    This divides ``bbox`` with the *exact* geometry of :func:`sample_grid`/
    :func:`ocr_grid` (same ``inset``, same bounds clamping, optional exact ``xs``/
    ``ys`` edges from :func:`detect_grid`, so the ``[r][c]`` indices line up
    one-to-one) and, for each cell: gates on ink exactly as :func:`ocr_grid` does
    (a cell with fewer than ``ink_min`` pixels deviating more than ``ink_tol``
    from its own mean is blank → ``empty_label``, never scored), then resamples
    the cell to a ``norm``x``norm`` luma signature and scores it against each
    template by mean-absolute-difference *per pixel*. Resampling to a fixed size
    is what makes the score comparable across templates (and cells) of unequal
    pixel size — a raw SAD favours whichever sprite happens to cover fewer pixels,
    and on an uneven ``xs``/``ys`` pitch no two cells are the same size. The
    lowest mean-diff label wins; if ``max_score`` is set and even the best exceeds
    it the cell is ``unknown_label`` (so an unexpected sprite — a highlighted
    square, a piece mid-animation — is flagged, not silently mislabelled).

    ``templates`` is a list of ``(label, patch, pw, ph)`` where ``patch`` is a
    ``pw*ph`` RGB buffer in the same format :func:`match_template` takes — the
    idiom is to harvest them once from a known frame (the chess start position
    gives all twelve pieces at known squares) by cropping cells with
    :func:`capture_patch`/:func:`crop_rgb`, then classify every later board with
    one call. Returns a ``rows``x``cols`` list of labels."""

    :func:`classify_grid` reads a sprite board only when it is a ``cols``x``rows``
    *lattice*. Many boards are not: a mahjongg layout is tiles stacked in offset
    3-D layers, a freecell/klondike spread is cards at ragged depths, a diffed
    frame yields change regions wherever they fell. The boxes are already in hand
    — from :func:`find_color_blobs` (segment the tile faces), :func:`detect_cascade`
    (the ``faceup`` box per pile), :func:`locate_change_blobs` (each changed
    region) — but to *read* them every caller re-rolls the same :func:`match_template`
    loop classify_grid already owns (crop, ink-gate, resample, argmin, threshold).
    This is that loop over an explicit box list: ``detect_*`` answers *where* the
    things are, ``classify_boxes`` answers *what* each one is.

    Scoring is identical to :func:`classify_grid` (they share the same core), so a
    library harvested once classifies both a lattice and a scatter: each box is
    inset by ``inset``, gated on ink (fewer than ``ink_min`` pixels deviating more
    than ``ink_tol`` from the box mean → ``empty_label``, never scored), resampled
    to a ``norm``x``norm`` luma signature and given the lowest mean-abs-diff label,
    or ``unknown_label`` when ``max_score`` is set and even the best exceeds it.
    ``boxes`` are *inclusive* ``(x0, y0, x1, y1)`` in screen coordinates — exactly
    the ``bbox`` :func:`find_color_blobs`/:func:`locate_change_blobs` return and
    :func:`crop_rgb` harvests templates from, so a box segmented one frame and its
    library harvested another line up to the pixel (a 1-px frame mismatch shifts a
    sharp glyph enough to fail its own self-match). Returns one label per box, in

    """Group a list of boxes into discovered visual classes with *no* template
    library — the unsupervised sibling of :func:`classify_boxes` (F256).

    :func:`classify_boxes`/:func:`classify_grid` answer *what* each box is, but
    only once you have harvested a labelled template per class. On a board whose
    alphabet you do not know in advance you cannot: a mid-game chess position, an
    unfamiliar mahjongg tileset, the change-regions of a never-seen game offer no
    known frame to crop labels from. Yet you can still ask the cheaper question
    the library hand-rolling was answering all along — *which of these boxes look
    the same?* — and that needs no labels at all. (F254 already hand-rolled this
    inline for mahjongg: seed a library on first sight, start a new entry when the
    best match exceeds a radius. This is that leader-clustering loop made a
    primitive, so the next board need not re-roll it.)

    Each box is measured by the exact pixel core of :func:`classify_boxes` — shared
    via :func:`_box_signature`: inset to the glyph-dominated centre, gate on ink,
    resample to a ``norm``x``norm`` luma signature — so clustering boxes and later
    classifying the same boxes agree pixel-for-pixel. The boxes are then grouped by
    single-pass *leader clustering*: each box joins the nearest existing cluster
    whose exemplar is within ``max_score`` mean-absolute-difference per pixel, else
    it founds a new cluster (and becomes that cluster's exemplar). Cluster ids are
    assigned in order of first appearance — the first non-blank box is cluster 0 —
    so the result is deterministic and order-stable. A blank box (gated out before
    scoring, exactly as in :func:`classify_boxes`) is ``blank`` (default ``-1``),
    never clustered.

    ``max_score`` is the merge radius, in the same luma units as the
    :func:`classify_boxes` threshold (mean-abs-diff per pixel, 0–255): too small
    over-splits a class on incidental variation (the same chess piece on a light vs
    a dark square), too large merges distinct classes — there is normally a wide
    plateau between, and the exemplar-not-centroid rule keeps a cluster anchored to
    a real box rather than drifting as members accrue. ``boxes`` are *inclusive*
    ``(x0, y0, x1, y1)`` exactly as :func:`classify_boxes` takes. Returns one
    cluster id per box, in input order — empty ``boxes`` returns ``[]``."""

    same-colour tiles, a klotski piece spans several cells, a flood-opened pocket
    in mines is a blob, a settled tetromino is four joined cells. The question
    after reading is therefore not "what is this cell" but "**which cells are the
    same object**", and the floor had no primitive for it: each game hand-rolled
    the identical flood fill over a reader's output. This is that flood fill, made
    a primitive — it consumes any reader's ``rows``x``cols`` label grid and

    ``grid`` is a rectangular list of rows of hashable labels (the exact shape a

    ``{label, cells, size, bbox}`` where ``cells`` is the region's ``(r, c)``
    coordinates (row-major within the region, so ``cells[0]`` is a safe click
    target for any shape, unlike a bbox centre on an L), ``size`` is ``len(cells)``
    and ``bbox`` is the inclusive ``(r0, c0, r1, c1)``. Regions are ordered by
    first appearance in a row-major scan (deterministic). A label in

    swell-foop board with cleared cells, a mines board's covered cells); pass

    is the wrong shape for the games whose whole rule is a **straight line**:
    connect-four wins on four collinear, gomoku / five-or-more on five, tic-tac-toe
    on three, and the F258 lesson itself punted "is this group a collinear run" back
    to the caller. Connected-components cannot answer it — eight-connectivity lumps
    a horizontal three, the diagonal touching it and the stack above into one blob
    and reports neither line; the run is a property of a *direction*, not of mere
    adjacency. Every line game therefore re-implemented the same four-axis scan over

    ``grid`` is a rectangular list of rows of hashable labels (the exact shape a

    no extra geometry. Runs are ordered by ``directions`` first, then by ``start``

    empty cells of a board); pass ``None`` to run over every label. ``min_len``

    wins, or to 1 to keep singletons. ``directions`` is any subset of ``"h"``

    a phantom ``cols × maxdepth`` grid whose cells mostly miss real cards, so
    every cascade game hand-rolls its own pile walk.

    Trying to segment *every* overlapped card is theme-brittle (back patterns and
    court-card frames mimic card-top lines). The robust invariant is coarser and
    enough: a pile is one **contiguous non-felt run** (cards touch, no felt
    between), so per column the run's top/bottom are unambiguous, and the
    **face-up card is the bottom ``card_h`` px** of that run (it is drawn on top,
    fully visible — felt lies just below it). Depth needn't be segmented: piles
    that differ by one card differ in height by one overlap ``pitch``, so
    ``depth ≈ round((height − card_h) / pitch) + 1``. With neither known they are
    inferred from the columns themselves — ``card_h`` = the shortest pile (a lone
    face-up card) and ``pitch`` = the modal positive gap between sorted pile
    heights — so a fresh deal needs no magic numbers.

    Per column returns ``{'present', 'top', 'bottom', 'height', 'depth',
    'faceup':(x0,y0,x1,y1)}`` (``faceup`` is the bottom card's clickable/readable
    box); plus top-level ``{'cols', 'xs', 'bg', 'card_h', 'pitch', 'cells':[...]}``
    — or ``None`` when ``search`` is degenerate. ``xs`` (e.g. straight from
    :func:`detect_grid`) reuses known column edges, else columns evenly split
    ``search``; ``bg`` defaults to the modal colour over ``search`` (the felt
    dominates the area). A row counts as card when ``>= fill`` of an inset centre
    band differs from ``bg`` by more than ``bg_tol``; runs bridge up to ``gap``
    felt rows so a thin separator never splits a pile, and the *longest* run per
    column is taken (a detached status bar / score line is ignored)."""

    dithering. A shift of ``+2`` per channel is invisible to the eye yet makes an
    exact compare report *every* pixel as changed, so "did it change?" fires on

    click you often need to know merely that *something happened* — a button lit
    up, a badge appeared, a spinner began, a row got selected — without knowing
    the eventual text or colour, and before any of it has settled. Reading
    immediately races the change and sees the old frame, so the agent concludes
    nothing happened and acts twice. This captures (or accepts) a ``baseline``
    snapshot of the region, then re-captures every ``interval`` until a capture
    differs from it. Returns ``{changed, pixels, captures, elapsed}`` —
    ``changed`` is whether the onset arrived before ``timeout`` and ``pixels``

    a blinking caret, a hover ring, a one-bit antialiasing wobble, or the mouse

    a colour but differ in shape (a glyph, an icon, a button state) are
    indistinguishable to them — and position is an arbitrary tie-breaker. This
    slides the ``pw``x``ph`` RGB ``patch`` over the captured desktop and scores
    every offset by sum-of-absolute-difference on luma; the lowest score is the
    closest match. Returns ``{x, y, score, bbox}`` centred on the match in
    *screen* coordinates (``score`` 0 = identical), or ``None`` if the search

    Cost is ``search_area x patch_area``, so constrain ``search``
    ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` — typically a ``find_color_blobs`` bbox padded
    by a few pixels — to keep the slide cheap; raise ``step`` for a coarse pass.

    (少則得): segment by colour, then ``match_template`` each candidate and take
    the lowest score.

    ``mask`` (F234): an optional ``pw*ph`` byte buffer where a non-zero byte marks
    a *foreground* pixel to score and a zero byte is ignored. A sprite cropped
    from one background carries that background in its bounding box; against a
    *different* background the background pixels dominate the SAD (a template that
    scored 0 at rest jumped to tens of thousands one node over and could lock onto
    a look-alike). Masking the patch to the sprite's own silhouette scores only
    what is actually the sprite, so it relocates across changing backgrounds —
    the human channel of tracking a shape and ignoring the scenery. ``score`` then

    ``match_template`` answers "where is the one closest match" — its arg-min
    early-abandon is built to find a single winner. But a repeated-element GUI
    asks the opposite: a mahjongg board has many copies of each tile face, a
    card layout repeats ranks, an inventory/match-3 grid tiles one icon dozens
    of times. To pair or count them you need *all* the places an appearance
    occurs, and the only way to get them from the single-best primitive was to
    blank each hit and rescan — O(hits) full slides and a caller-managed mask.

    This scores every offset (same SAD-on-luma as ``match_template``, honouring
    ``mask``/``step``/``search``), keeps those at or below ``max_score``, then
    applies non-maximum suppression so each real instance yields one hit instead
    of a cluster of near-identical offsets. Returns a list of
    ``{x, y, score, bbox}`` (screen coords, centred on each match) sorted by
    ascending score, at most ``limit`` entries.

    ``max_score`` is the absolute SAD ceiling; when ``None`` it is derived from
    the best score as ``best + 0.04 * 255 * scored_pixels`` — i.e. tolerate ~4%
    average luma drift per pixel beyond the closest match, which keeps genuine
    anti-aliased/shadowed copies while rejecting different faces. ``min_sep``
    ``(dx, dy)`` is the NMS exclusion box (default the patch size) so two hits
    cannot overlap. Same costing as ``match_template`` (``search_area x

    way to tell which. On a *periodic* surface that is a trap: a brick wall, a row
    of identical list items, a grid of like icons, a board of identical tiles all
    repeat, and which copy wins the arg-min is then decided by sub-pixel noise. A
    tracker that re-locates each frame silently jumps onto the wrong copy (a false
    lock), and downstream :func:`servo`/aim chases a phantom — and the single-best
    primitive cannot even report that the match was ambiguous. (Honesty note: in
    OpenArena the live walls/floor were *not* periodic enough to tie the real
    fine-step matcher — it located every sampled patch correctly; the measured gap
    was the missing *confidence*, with live margins ranging 0.15 on a busy floor to
    1.0 on a unique feature. The outright false-lock is reproduced where the motif
    truly repeats: a live patch tiled into a periodic strip.)

    This judges *trustworthiness* before returning a point. It scans for every
    instance (:func:`match_template_all`, one pass, NMS so each copy yields one
    hit), takes the best, and finds the best **rival** — the next instance at
    least a patch-size away. The match is unique only if that rival is clearly
    worse: ``margin = (rival.score - best.score) / rival.score`` in ``[0, 1)``,
    where ~0 means the rival is just as good (ambiguous) and larger means the
    winner stands alone. With ``require_unique`` (the default) an ambiguous match
    returns ``None`` — turning a silent false-lock into an honest "I cannot
    uniquely place this" — so it is a safe drop-in for ``match_template`` inside
    a tracking loop. With ``require_unique=False`` it always returns the dict so

    ``lead`` (F264) fits a velocity from one feature's history over *time*; this
    is its spatial twin — it fuses *many* features at one instant into a single
    global shift. Practice forced it. Panning a side-scroller (SuperTux), a
    block-flow over the foreground reads, between two frames, a uniform world
    translation — the scene has one depth, so geometrically one shift is right
    (unlike FPS yaw's rotational, range-dependent flow, which F264 rejected a
    global shift for). But the *measurement* is not clean: the repeating ice
    texture makes each :func:`match_unique` vote land a tile-fraction off, and a
    few blocks gross-mislock — so a plain mean is dragged toward the outliers
    and a median lands in the empty gap *between* vote clusters (measured: a
    real ~-26 px pan produced per-block votes spread -48..0 px with two stray
    votes at +128 and -128; the median read -20 px but only 31 % of blocks lay
    within a few px of it, so its confidence was unreadable). Nothing in the
    floor turned a cloud of disagreeing displacement votes into one shift *with
    a stated confidence*, nor refused when the votes had no agreement at all
    (a scene transition / death frame / motion past the search window scatters
    votes across the whole range with no dominant value).

    ``votes`` is an iterable of ``(dx, dy)`` displacements (e.g. one per tracked
    block); entries with a ``None`` component are dropped, so this pairs with
    :func:`match_unique`'s honest misses without the caller stitching gaps. The
    dominant shift is the ``(dx, dy)`` with the most votes within ``tol`` pixels
    (Chebyshev) of it — a coarse 2-D translation mode / Hough vote — refined to
    the mean of those inliers. ``tol`` should be on the order of the locate
    noise / feature spacing (a tile, here). Returns ``None`` when fewer than
    ``min_votes`` valid votes survive or the best shift's support (inlier
    fraction) is below ``min_support`` — the flow-domain analog of
    ``match_unique``'s margin gate: report a shift only when one shift commands
    a majority. Otherwise returns ``{dx, dy, support, inliers, n, tol}``:
    ``dx``/``dy`` the refined shift, ``support`` the inlier fraction in
    ``[0, 1]``, ``inliers`` their count, ``n`` total votes considered."""

    """Fit a robust *affine* flow field to position-tagged displacement
    ``votes`` — the model a camera rotation needs and that ``consensus_shift``
    can only reject (F267).

    ``consensus_shift`` (F265) fits one global translation and, honestly, refuses
    a scene whose flow is not a single shift — its own docstring names FPS yaw as
    that case. Practice then pinned down *why*, and what the right model is.
    Yawing an OpenArena view by a fixed amount and reading per-block displacement
    over the viewport, the horizontal flow was not one value and was not a few
    discrete layers: it was a smooth, repeatable ramp down the frame — measured
    ``dx`` ``-72`` px across the top band, ``-60``, ``-48``, ``-36`` across the
    bottom, each band tight (IQR ~6 px), the histogram a gap-free plateau from
    ``-36`` to ``-72`` with no clusters. ``consensus_shift`` returned ``None``
    (correct: no single shift owns a majority), but nothing in the floor could
    *represent* that flow. A camera rotation / perspective pan produces exactly
    this — image velocity affine in image position — so the honest generalisation
    of a global shift is a global *affine* field, which also degrades back to a
    pure translation when its linear terms vanish (a side-scroller pan).

    ``votes`` is an iterable of ``(x, y, dx, dy)``: the image position ``(x, y)``
    of a tracked block and its measured displacement ``(dx, dy)`` (e.g. each from
    a :func:`match_unique` hit). Entries with any ``None`` component are dropped,
    pairing with the matcher's honest misses. Both components are fit as
    ``d = c0 + c1·x + c2·y`` by least squares; centring the seed positions makes
    the normal equations collapse to a 2x2 solve per component, with the constant
    term the mean displacement. The fit is made robust by iteratively trimming
    seeds whose residual exceeds ``median + outlier_k·MAD`` (never below
    ``resid_floor`` px, so a near-perfect fit is not over-pruned) and refitting,
    up to ``max_iter`` rounds or until the inlier set is stable — so a few gross
    mislocks or an independently-moving object do not bend the global field.

    Returns ``None`` when fewer than ``min_votes`` valid votes survive, when the
    seed positions are degenerate (collinear / single column or row, so a
    gradient is unidentifiable — an honest refusal rather than a wild
    extrapolation), or when the inlier fraction falls below ``min_support``.
    Otherwise returns ``{ax, bx, ay, by, support, inliers, n, rms, cx, cy}``:
    ``ax`` is ``(c0, c1, c2)`` for ``dx`` and ``ay`` likewise for ``dy`` (absolute
    image coords, so ``dx ≈ ax[0] + ax[1]·x + ax[2]·y``); ``bx``/``by`` are the
    same coefficients re-expressed about the seed centroid ``(cx, cy)`` as
    ``(mean_d, d/dx, d/dy)``, so ``bx[0]``/``by[0]`` are the shift at the frame
    centre (what to feed an aim loop) and ``bx[1:]``/``by[1:]`` the gradient (zero
    => a pure translation, i.e. the ``consensus_shift`` regime). ``support`` is
    the inlier fraction, ``rms`` the inlier residual in px."""

    pans *every* pixel changes, so it floods — it cannot tell a moving object
    from the moving world. Subtracting a single :func:`consensus_shift`
    translation only works when the world's flow is one shift (it is not, for a
    yaw — F267). Nothing in the floor turned "motion relative to the modelled

    subtract; when ``None`` it is fit here from ``votes`` (so the global model
    and the residual come from one call). Each seed's residual is its
    displacement minus the field's prediction at its position; seeds whose
    residual magnitude is at least ``min_resid`` px survive, and survivors are
    grouped by single-link spatial proximity (within ``cluster_radius`` px, the

    active, e.g. mean/max luminance of a tile's patch) or a ``{name: scalar}``
    mapping (keys taken from the first frame and required in every frame). An event
    fires for a region on the frame its level first *rises* across that region's
    gate — edge-triggered, not level: while it stays above the gate no further
    event fires; it must fall back to the gate for ``refractory`` frames to re-arm,
    so one flash spanning many frames is one event and a tile that flashes twice is
    two. The gate is per-region, ``gate_i = base_i + thresh*(peak_i - base_i)``, so
    a dim region and a bright one are each judged on their own dynamic range; a
    flat region (``peak_i == base_i``) never fires. ``baseline`` / ``peak`` may be
    given explicitly (list or ``{name: scalar}``); by default each region's min /
    max over ``levels`` is used.

    cold-start reader for UIs that draw their own glyphs (canvas, OpenGL/SDL
    games, custom toolkits) where AT-SPI exposes geometry but no value (F231).

    The floor already reads canvas text dependency-free via the
    :func:`read_glyph`/:func:`read_text` atlas ladder, but that ladder needs a
    reference *atlas* — labelled glyphs — and an agent facing a font it has never
    seen cannot label one without first reading it. This breaks that chicken-and-
    egg: tesseract reads arbitrary glyphs with no atlas, so its output can label
    reference cells from which a fast :func:`read_glyph` atlas is built for the
    rest of the session (engine for the cold start, structure for the warm path).
    It is an *optional* extension (see :func:`_ocr_engine`) — the floor imports
    and runs without it, and the atlas ladder stays the default reader.

    Grabs ``region`` ``(x, y, w, h)`` (whole screen if ``None``), upscales by
    ``scale`` and greyscales it (small glyphs OCR poorly at native size), then
    pipes a hand-rolled PNG to tesseract and returns the recognised text,
    stripped.

    ``whitelist`` constrains the alphabet (e.g. ``"0123456789"`` for a score, or
    ``"12345678"`` for a minesweeper cell) — the single biggest accuracy win on
    short fixed-charset readouts. ``psm`` is tesseract's page-segmentation mode
    (7 = one text line, 10 = one character, 6 = a block). ``invert`` handles
    light-on-dark text. Pass an existing ``rgb``/``size`` to OCR several regions
    from one capture. Pairs with AT-SPI for *where* + OCR for *what* — the hybrid
    that drives self-drawn surfaces a semantic tree cannot describe.

    A caller's instinct on a lone digit is ``psm=10`` ("one character") — but on
    a tight, isolated glyph tesseract's line/char segmentation (7 and 10) treats
    the round digits ``4 6 8 9`` as stray ink and emits *nothing*, while block
    mode (6) reads them; a sudoku board that scored 66/81 under per-cell psm=10
    read 81/81 under psm=6 (F235). So when a ``whitelist`` read comes back empty
    yet the crop *holds ink*, this retries once in ``fallback_psm`` (block, 6) —
    turning a silent drop into a read without ever overriding a hit, and skipping
    genuinely blank cells so a ' '-means-empty caller (minesweeper) is unaffected.
    Feed the *greyscale* crop, never a hard 1-bit threshold: the anti-aliased
    edges are tesseract's signal, and binarising first is what drops those glyphs.
    Set ``fallback_psm=0`` to disable the retry."""

    Every other primitive here reads a *single* ``capture_rgb`` snapshot, but a
    live UI animates: by the time a synthesised click lands, an element that was
    sliding/teleporting has moved on, so the click hits where the target *used to
    be*. The result is the usual ``find_color`` dict plus ``settled`` (bool),
    ``samples`` (int) and ``saccades`` (full-screen re-acquisitions).

    Why pursuit, not a fixed-rate full-screen poll. A whole-screen ``find_color``
    scan is *slow* (millions of pixels in Python), so a fixed poll samples the
    page only a few times a second — slower than a 180 ms animation step. Then two
    successive samples can land an even number of steps apart and read the *same*
    spot, so the motion is **undersampled** (Nyquist) and it can "settle" mid-flight.
    The eye does not solve this by staring at the whole wall faster; it *foveates* —
    a tiny high-acuity window it can re-read tens of times a second — and **pursues**
    the target, **saccading** only when the target leaves that window. So here:
    acquire once with a full grab, then track inside a ``2·radius`` fovea via
    :func:`foveate` at a fast poll. While the fovea keeps finding the target within
    ``move_tol`` it is at rest; hold that for a wall-clock ``settle_frames·interval``
    seconds and it is settled. The instant the target leaves the fovea — a teleport,
    or a slide past the window — that *absence* is the motion signal (大音希聲: the
    silence is the note): re-anchor with one full-screen saccade and keep pursuing.
    Because the dense sampling is foveal (cheap) the sampler always out-paces the
    motion, and because leaving the fovea resets the hold, it cannot false-settle
    mid-motion — on either platform, with no cadence tuning to a particular display.

    :func:`read_text` :func:`segment_run`-s a line into per-glyph cells and joins
    the labels with *nothing* between them — it records only *where* the inked
    cells are, never the *width* of the blank between them. Draw a line with a
    real word gap (``"OK  CAB"``) and it reads ``"OKCAB"``: the space the page
    left between words is dropped, because a blank column is a blank column to it
    whether it parts two letters or two words. ``read_text`` cannot tell an
    inter-letter gap from an inter-word gap — that is its named boundary.

    The gaps between cells carry the missing signal: they are *bimodal*. The gaps
    *inside* a word (between its letters) cluster small and roughly equal; the gap
    *between* words is markedly wider. This reads each cell as in :func:`read_text`,
    measures the horizontal blank between every adjacent pair, takes the median
    gap as the typical inter-letter spacing, and inserts a single ``' '`` wherever
    a gap is ``>= space_k`` times that median — a clear word seam, not a letter's
    own spacing. The labels join in reading order with spaces only at those seams.

    Honest only where the spacing is *bimodal*: it needs the letter gaps to
    cluster below the word gap (true for words of more than one letter). When the
    gaps are uniform — a single word, evenly-tracked display type where the word
    gap barely exceeds the letter gap — no gap clears the threshold and it reads
    the run as a single space-less word rather than inventing a break. It never
    splits a run it cannot read (empty ink → ``""``) and never guesses a space the

    The region carries the answer. A label is a large flat field of *background*

    Honest about absence: a *uniform* region (a blank panel, a solid fill) has no

    tree reports, a cell you just typed, a word the app drew that you can name another

    Given the region's pixels and its true ``label``, this segments the run into one

    has *already* cut the run may pass ``cells`` to skip segmentation (e.g. one isolated
    swatch per glyph). Repeated characters collapse to their last rendering (the same
    glyph, so harmless); spaces in ``label`` are skipped (they ink no cell).

    Honest only where the run can be *aligned* to its label: if segmentation cannot
    produce exactly one cell per non-space character — touching glyphs :func:`split_run`
    still cannot part, or stray ink — it returns ``{}`` rather than mislabel cells by a
    wrong-length zip (a shifted alignment would poison every later read). Empty ink or

    The two readers above each see only half of a coloured paragraph.

    :func:`segment_lines` bands rows only where *that one colour* inks them: give
    it a block whose first line is red and second green and it finds one band and

    ``"ONOKGBYO"``, every word shattered across the line break. One reader keeps the
    colours and loses the rows; the other keeps the rows and loses the colours.

    This keeps both. It asks :func:`palette` for the block's inks, then bands the
    rows the way :func:`segment_lines` does but counting a row inked when *any* ink
    touches it (not one named ``fg``) — so a line of any colour, or of several,

    :func:`read_region_words` fold those cells into a single joined string and the

    alone — no glyph atlas (F181).

    Every reader from F103 on (:func:`read_text`, :func:`locate_word`) needs an
    ``atlas`` of the target font's glyphs, and the only way the floor could build
    one was rendering reference glyphs *itself* on a browser scratch canvas — so
    it stayed literate only on the web and blind to every *native* canvas app
    (Blender, a CAD viewport, a video timeline) whose font it cannot reproduce.
    Harvesting an atlas from the app's *own* rendering founders one rung lower, on
    *glyph* segmentation: a ~9px proportional anti-aliased label fuses or splits
    its letters unreliably (``"File"`` cuts into four, ``"Render"`` shatters into
    twelve), so per-character reading is lost — that is the named boundary of the
    atlas path on small native type.

    But you do not need to *read* a menu bar / dropdown / toolbar / tab strip to
    *act* on it: it is an *ordered sequence of known labels* parted by *wide* blank
    space, and item-level gaps are far larger and far more reliable than the
    inter-letter gaps that defeat glyph segmentation. With ``axis="x"`` this
    :func:`segment_run`-s ``bbox`` by the foreground colour ``fg`` into
    blank-*column*-separated runs (a horizontal bar/tab strip); with ``axis="y"``
    it parts the region into blank-*row*-separated bands (a vertical dropdown — the
    even more reliable case, since menu rows are spaced wider than letters are
    tall). Either way, *only when* the run count equals ``len(labels)`` it returns
    ``{label: rect}`` pairing each label to its run in reading order — a click
    target for every label, located by meaning, in the screen frame
    :func:`capture_rgb` and :func:`click` share, independent of pixel coordinates,
    window position or theme. Hand any rect's centre to :func:`click` to press the
    label you named.

    Honest boundary: it commits only when it can form *exactly* ``len(labels)``
    bands; if it cannot, it returns ``{}`` rather than risk pairing a label to the
    wrong box. It locates *known* labels in *known* order; it does not read unknown
    text (that is the atlas path, bounded above). Choose ``fg`` as the label ink
    colour; ``gap`` only seeds the fast path below.

    Two segmenters, fast then count-driven (F181). The fast path is a single fixed
    ``gap`` blank-run cut (:func:`segment_run` on ``x``, :func:`_segment_rows` on
    ``y``) — it nails *uniform* strips (a menu bar, a plain dropdown) in one pass.
    But a real menu is rarely uniform: the File menu interleaves shortcut text,
    submenu arrows and several separator rules, so *no* single ``gap`` yields the
    right band count (too small splits a separator in two, too large fuses two
    items). The robust path borrows the exact discipline of :func:`split_run`,
    which parts *touching glyphs* by cutting at the ``n-1`` deepest valleys once it
    is told the glyph count ``n``: here the honest extra knowledge is the *label*
    count, so when the fast path's band count ≠ ``len(labels)`` we cut the ink
    profile at its ``len(labels)-1`` **widest blank valleys** — exactly enough cuts
    to make exactly that many bands, robust to uneven item spacing because it ranks
    gaps relatively instead of thresholding them absolutely. It still degrades
    honestly: if there are fewer than ``len(labels)-1`` interior gaps, or any band
    comes out empty, it yields ``{}`` rather than a mispairing."""

    :func:`scroll` (F119) can reach past the fold, but only by a *guessed* amount:
    the caller must know how many notches the target lies below, and a fixed roll
    over- or under-shoots — too few and the word never enters the frame, too many
    and it flies past the top and out again (the F119 probe lost ``GO`` at the
    first overshoot). And :func:`locate_phrase` still only reads the one screenful
    it is handed. To *find* text on a surface taller than the window you must
    search and scroll together, and know when to stop.

    This marries the two. It looks for ``target`` in the current frame
    (:func:`locate_phrase` over ``bbox``); finding it, returns its bbox at once.
    Else it rolls the wheel down ``step`` notches over ``(x, y)`` (the region's

    time, up to ``max_steps`` rolls — so ``box = scroll_to_phrase(field, atlas,
    "SUBMIT")`` brings a button anywhere down a long page into view and hands back
    where to press it, the window walking itself to the text instead of the caller
    counting notches.

    It bounds the search by ``max_steps`` rather than by pixels-stopped-changing,
    and that is deliberate honesty: a long blank stretch scrolls past while the
    captured screen does not change a single byte (the scrollbar thumb does not
    register in a GDI grab), so "the frame held still" cannot tell *bottomed out*
    from *still travelling through emptiness* — a pixel-only reader simply has no
    truthful bottom signal, and pretending one (stopping on a still frame) would
    abandon a target that lies just past the blank. So it promises only to look
    across ``max_steps`` successive screenfuls; set ``max_steps`` to cover the
    surface (``page_height / screenful`` rolls of ``step``).

    Honest in its parts' frames at every step (banded rows, bimodal seams,
    ``atlas`` glyphs, text colours) and honest about its reach: it reads only what
    each roll reveals and declares failure only after exhausting ``max_steps``.
