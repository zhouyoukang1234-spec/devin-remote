"""Visual world model -- a model-free, PIXEL-ONLY forward model that GROWS from practice.

Motivation (the root critique): semantic adapters (HWND/UIA/DOM) are blind to strong-GUI apps
-- 3D modelling, video editing, painting, games -- whose whole surface is a custom-drawn canvas
with no accessibility tree and CONTINUOUS control. There the only universal channel is what a
human actually uses: a mouse + keyboard acting on PIXELS. The hard part is not the action set
(it is tiny and universal) but the KERNEL: predict what an action will do, act to verify/approach
a goal, and update when surprised.

This module is the seed of that kernel. It does NOT hard-code any app. It accumulates episodes
of (perceptual context, action, observed local visual change) and, from that growing experience,
predicts the change a proposed action SHOULD produce and scores the actual outcome against it.
The architecture is meant to grow out of practice, not be fixed up front -- so this stays small
and empirical (nearest-neighbour over episodes), pure stdlib, zero deps, EXE-freezable.

Perception feature: a region's block-averaged gray grid (the same cheap signal the agent already
computes). Change descriptor: magnitude + centroid + an L2-normalised down-pooled |delta| field
("change fingerprint"). Prediction: average the fingerprints of past episodes with the same
action, weighted by context similarity. Verification: cosine similarity of predicted vs observed
fingerprint + magnitude agreement. High residual = genuine surprise (the only time we escalate).
