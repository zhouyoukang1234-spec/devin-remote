# Model Context Protocol servers

This repository is a collection of *reference implementations* for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references to community-built servers and additional resources.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are looking for a list of MCP servers, you can browse published servers on [the MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/). The repository served by this README is dedicated to housing just the small number of reference servers maintained by the MCP steering group.

> [!WARNING]
> The servers in this repository are intended as **reference implementations** to demonstrate MCP features and SDK usage. They are meant to serve as educational examples for developers building their own MCP servers, not as production-ready solutions. Developers should evaluate their own security requirements and implement appropriate safeguards based on their specific threat model and use case.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.
Typically, each MCP server is implemented with an MCP SDK:

- [C# MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk)
- [Go MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk)
- [Java MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk)
- [Kotlin MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk)
- [PHP MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk)
- [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)
- [Ruby MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ruby-sdk)
- [Rust MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk)
- [Swift MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk)
- [TypeScript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository
TypeScript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`.

For example, this will start the [Memory](src/memory) server:
```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:
```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and [these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, wrap `npx` with `cmd /c`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, apply the same wrapper to each `npx`-based entry above by changing `"command"` to `"cmd"` and prepending `"/c", "npx"` to the existing `args`. Leave `uvx` entries unchanged.
